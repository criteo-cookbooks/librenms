# Rules defined there are of course debatable.
# If you want to modify them:
# - discuss this with sre-core members
# - submit the change in the code_generator

### Disable line length constraint
Layout/LineLength:
  Max: 180
# Because we're not in the 80s anymore.
# Based on data from http://sideeffect.kr/popularconvention#ruby
#
### Comma after each line in a list
Style/TrailingCommaInArrayLiteral:
  EnforcedStyleForMultiline: comma
Style/TrailingCommaInHashLiteral:
  EnforcedStyleForMultiline: comma
# It is very common to add key/value pairs to hashes in Chef attributes. Making
# sure each line has a comma diminishes the chance of someone making an error
# when adding a new pair. It also makes the code look more consistent. There is
# also a good explanation on why this is enabled by default in Puppet
# (see: http://www.puppetcookbook.com/posts/trailing-commas.html).
#
# Instead of writing:
#   default['cookbook']['attribute'] = {
#     a: 'a',
#     b: 'b'
#   }
# you should write:
#   default['cookbook']['attribute'] = {
#     a: 'a',
#     b: 'b',
#   }
#
### Align hashes as a table
Layout/HashAlignment:
  EnforcedColonStyle: table
  EnforcedHashRocketStyle: key
# When dealing with long key names, it is easier to read hashes in colon
# notation aligned as tables. However, the same does not seem to hold true
# for hashes in rocket notation due to strange alignment rules.
#
# Instead of writing:
#   default['cookbook']['attribute'] = {
#     a: 'a',
#     bb: 'b',
#     ccc: 'c',
#   }
# you should write:
#   default['cookbook']['attribute'] = {
#     a:   'a',
#     bb:  'b',
#     ccc: 'c',
#   }
